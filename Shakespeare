Shall I compare thee to a winter’s day?
winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And winter’s lease hath all too short a date;
Sometime the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
